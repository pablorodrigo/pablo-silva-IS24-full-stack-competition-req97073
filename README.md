This is a Next.js project called "pablo-silva-is24-full-stack-competition-req97073" that uses TypeScript and is
bootstrapped with create-next-app. It includes various dependencies and devDependencies such as React, Next.js,
TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, and several UI libraries like PrimeReact and swagger-ui-react.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 14.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)  package manager

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) for this project can be accessed
on [http://localhost:3000/api/products](http://localhost:3000/api/products). This endpoint can be edited
in `pages/api/products/index.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated
as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and
load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## API Docs

- Due to the limitations of Next.js, the path for the Swagger page has been updated to `/api-docs` instead of the originally intended path of `/api/api-docs`.
